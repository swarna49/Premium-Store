# 🌈 My Amazing Online Shop (The Easiest Guide!)

Hi there! 👋 This is a magic website I built. Imagine you are building a LEGO set—this website is like an already built LEGO castle that you can explore!

## 🏠 What's inside my LEGO Castle?

- **The Shop Window**: A beautiful place to look at items (we call this the **Frontend**).
- **The Magic Brain**: A secret part that remembers everything, like your name and what's in your cart (we call this the **Backend**).
- **The Secret Vault**: A special room ONLY for the boss. When you log in as the boss, you can change prices and add new toys!

## 🎨 How it works (The Magic Ingredients)

- **Next.js**: The "Super Glue" that holds everything together.
- **MongoDB**: Our "Big Toy Box" where we keep all the info.
- **CSS**: The "Magic Wand" that makes the website pretty and colorful.
- **Stripe**: The "Gold Coins" system for buying things safely.

Even if you have never coded before, you can do this! Just follow these 4 tiny steps:

### Step 1: Open the Folder
Open the folder named `client` on your computer.

### Step 2: Talk to the computer
Right-click and open "Terminal" or "Command Prompt". Type this secret spell:
